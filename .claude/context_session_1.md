# Context Session 1 - Project Foundation

## Current Status
Analyzing existing codebase and first implementation steps. Project already has Next.js foundation, authentication, and basic features implemented.

## Session Objectives
**Focus**: Verify completion of step 1.1 and determine next implementation priorities
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**TDD Phase**: Assessment and continuation

## Context from Previous Sessions
**Completed**: 
- Next.js 14 project initialization appears complete
- TypeScript and App Router configured
- Basic authentication system implemented
- Project builds successfully

**Current Targets**:
- Verify step 1.1 completion status
- Identify next step to implement

## Implementation Requirements
**Core Tasks**:
- Check if step 1.1 (Initialize Next.js 14) is complete
- Create CLAUDE.md with essential information
- Move to next incomplete step

**Success Criteria**:
- Step 1.1 verified as complete
- Context session file created
- Next step identified

## Agent Consultations (Only If Needed)
- [ ] **test-engineer-tdd**: If testing issues
- [ ] **frontend-architect**: If complex UI  
- [ ] **supabase-database-expert**: If schema changes
- [ ] **nextjs-fullstack-developer**: If complex business logic

## Research Findings
Step 1.1 appears complete based on:
