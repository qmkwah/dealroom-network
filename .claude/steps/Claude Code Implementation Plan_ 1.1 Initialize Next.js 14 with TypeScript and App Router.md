# Claude Code Implementation Plan: 1.1 Initialize Next.js 14 with TypeScript and App Router

## Objective
Set up the foundational Next.js project with TypeScript and the App Router, ensuring a robust and modern development environment.

## Detailed Steps (TDD Approach)

1.  **Understand the Goal**: The goal is to create a new Next.js project. This involves running the `create-next-app` command and navigating into the newly created directory. The success criteria will be the presence of the expected project structure and the ability to run the development server.

2.  **Write Tests (Pre-implementation)**:
    *   **Test Case 1: Project Directory Creation**: Verify that a directory named `dealroom-network` is created.
    *   **Test Case 2: Core Files Presence**: Check for the existence of `package.json`, `next.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, and `src/app/layout.tsx` within the new directory, indicating a successful Next.js setup with TypeScript and App Router.
    *   **Test Case 3: Development Server Start**: Attempt to start the Next.js development server and confirm it runs without immediate errors. This will be a manual verification step for now, but can be automated later with E2E tests.

3.  **Implement the Task**: Execute the following shell commands:
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest dealroom-network --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
    cd dealroom-network
    ```

4.  **Run Tests & Verify**: After executing the commands, manually verify the presence of the files and attempt to run `npm run dev` to ensure the server starts. If any test fails, debug and re-run until all pass.
