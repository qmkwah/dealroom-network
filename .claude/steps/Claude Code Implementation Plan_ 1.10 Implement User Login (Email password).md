# Claude Code Implementation Plan: 1.10 Implement User Login (Email/Password)

## Objective
Enable registered users to log in to the platform using their email and password, establishing a secure session.

## Detailed Steps (TDD Approach)

1.  **Understand the Goal**: Create a user login page and API endpoint that allows users to authenticate. This involves creating a form, handling form submission, and interacting with Supabase Auth to sign in an existing user.

2.  **Write Tests (Pre-implementation)**:
    *   **Test Case 1: Login Page Accessibility**: Verify that the `/login` route renders the login form.
    *   **Test Case 2: Successful Login**: Simulate a user filling out the login form with valid email and password. Assert that the user is successfully authenticated and redirected to the dashboard or a protected route.
    *   **Test Case 3: Invalid Credentials**: Simulate submitting the form with incorrect email or password. Assert that an appropriate error message is displayed and the user is not logged in.
    *   **Test Case 4: Session Persistence**: After a successful login, verify that the user's session is persisted across page refreshes or browser restarts (e.g., by checking for the presence of a session token or a logged-in state).

3.  **Implement the Task**: 
    *   **Create Login Page (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)**:
        *   Design a simple form with email and password input fields, and a submit button.
        *   Use Shadcn/ui components for form elements.
        *   Implement client-side validation.
