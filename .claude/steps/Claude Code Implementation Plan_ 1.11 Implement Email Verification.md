# Claude Code Implementation Plan: 1.11 Implement Email Verification

## Objective
Implement an email verification process for newly registered users to confirm their email addresses and enhance account security.

## Detailed Steps (TDD Approach)

1.  **Understand the Goal**: After registration, users should receive an email with a verification link. Clicking this link should mark their email as verified in the database, granting them full access to the platform.

2.  **Write Tests (Pre-implementation)**:
    *   **Test Case 1: Verification Email Sent**: After a new user registers, assert that a verification email is sent to their provided email address. (This might involve checking email logs or a mock email service).
    *   **Test Case 2: Successful Email Verification**: Simulate a user clicking the verification link. Assert that the user's `verified_at` timestamp in the Supabase `auth.users` table is updated and they are redirected to a success page or the dashboard.
    *   **Test Case 3: Access Before Verification**: Attempt to access a protected route or feature with an unverified user account. Assert that access is denied and a message prompting verification is displayed.
    *   **Test Case 4: Access After Verification**: Attempt to access the same protected route or feature with a verified user account. Assert that access is granted.
    *   **Test Case 5: Invalid/Expired Verification Link**: Simulate clicking an invalid or expired verification link. Assert that an error message is displayed and the user remains unverified.

3.  **Implement the Task**: 
    *   **Supabase Configuration**: Ensure Supabase's email templates for verification are configured (this is typically done in the Supabase dashboard under Authentication -> Email Templates).
    *   **Registration Flow Modification**: After a user signs up using `supabase.auth.signUp()`, Supabase automatically sends the verification email. Ensure your application handles the post-registration flow, perhaps by redirecting to a
