# Claude Code Implementation Plan: 4.2 Create Subscription Plan Management

## Objective
Develop the user interface to display available subscription plans and enable administrators to manage these plans.

## Detailed Steps (TDD Approach)

1.  **Understand the Goal**: Users need to see the different subscription tiers offered by the platform, along with their features and pricing. Additionally, an admin interface should allow for the creation, modification, and deletion of these plans.

2.  **Write Tests (Pre-implementation)**:
    *   **Test Case 1: Pricing Page Accessibility**: Navigate to the pricing page (e.g., `/pricing`). Assert that the page loads and displays the different subscription plans.
    *   **Test Case 2: Plan Details Display**: For each plan, assert that its name, price, and key features are correctly displayed.
    *   **Test Case 3: Admin Plan Management UI (if applicable)**: Log in as an `admin` user. Navigate to the subscription management section (e.g., `/admin/subscriptions`). Assert that a UI is available to list, create, and edit subscription plans.
    *   **Test Case 4: Plan Creation (Admin)**: As an `admin`, use the UI to create a new subscription plan. Assert that the plan is successfully created in the database and, if applicable, in Stripe.
    *   **Test Case 5: Plan Editing (Admin)**: As an `admin`, edit an existing subscription plan. Assert that the changes are reflected in the database and Stripe.

3.  **Implement the Task**: 
    *   **Frontend Pricing Page (`src/app/(public)/pricing/page.tsx`)**:
        *   Fetch subscription plan details (e.g., name, description, price, features) from a configuration file, a database table, or directly from Stripe (though caching is recommended for performance).
        *   Display each subscription plan as a card or a section, highlighting its benefits and pricing.
        *   Include a call-to-action button (e.g., "Choose Plan", "Subscribe") for each plan.
    *   **Backend API for Subscription Plans (if fetching from DB/Stripe)**:
        *   Create an API route (`GET /api/subscriptions/plans`) that fetches the list of available subscription plans. This route might query your database (if you store plan details there) or directly query the Stripe API to get product and price information.
    *   **Admin Interface for Plan Management (Optional, but good for long-term)**:
        *   If an admin role is fully implemented, create an admin page (e.g., `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/subscriptions/page.tsx`) where administrators can:
            *   List all existing subscription plans.
            *   Add new plans (which would involve creating products and prices in Stripe via API calls).
            *   Edit existing plans (updating details in Stripe).
            *   Delete plans (carefully, as this affects existing subscribers).
        *   These actions would require corresponding backend API routes (e.g., `POST /api/admin/subscriptions/plans`, `PUT /api/admin/subscriptions/plans/[id]`, `DELETE /api/admin/subscriptions/plans/[id]`).

4.  **Run Tests & Verify**: 
    *   Manually navigate to the pricing page and verify that all plans are displayed correctly.
    *   If an admin interface is built, test creating, editing, and deleting plans and verify that these changes are reflected on the frontend pricing page and in your Stripe Dashboard.
    *   (For automated tests) Use Playwright to navigate to the pricing page and assert the presence and correctness of subscription plan details.
