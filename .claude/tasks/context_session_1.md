# Context Session 1 - Authentication System Implementation

## Current Status
Starting implementation of Day 2: Authentication System Tests + Implementation from CLAUDE.md

## Task Overview
**Day 2: Authentication System Tests + Implementation (12 hours)**

### TDD Phase - Write Tests First (4 hours):
- [ ] Setup Jest and React Testing Library for testing framework
- [ ] Write tests for authentication API routes (login, register, logout)
- [ ] Write tests for email verification flow
- [ ] Write tests for password reset functionality
- [ ] Write tests for role-based authentication middleware
- [ ] Write tests for protected route components
- [ ] Write tests for login/register form validation
- [ ] Write tests for authentication state management
- [ ] Ensure all tests fail initially (red phase)

### Implementation Phase (8 hours):
- [ ] Implement Supabase authentication with email/password
- [ ] Create login and registration forms with validation
- [ ] Setup email verification flow
- [ ] Implement role-based authentication (sponsor/investor/provider)
- [ ] Create protected route middleware
- [ ] Build user profile creation flow
- [ ] Setup password reset functionality
- [ ] Make all tests pass (green phase)

## Project Context
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with auth, storage, realtime)
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library (to be set up)
- **Validation**: Zod with React Hook Form
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/ui components

## Current Project Structure
Day 1 is marked as completed in CLAUDE.md:
- ✅ Next.js 14+ with TypeScript and App Router
- ✅ Tailwind CSS configuration
- ✅ Shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Supabase project setup
- ✅ Basic project structure
- ✅ ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript settings
- ✅ Basic layout components
- ✅ Theme provider setup

## Next Steps
1. Consult test-engineer-tdd agent for comprehensive research and test setup
2. Agent will create documentation in .claude/docs/ 
3. Implement based on agent's research and recommendations
4. Update this context file with progress

## Agent Consultations
- **✅ COMPLETED**: test-engineer-tdd agent consultation for authentication system setup
  - **Documentation Created**: `.claude\docs\authentication-system-tdd.md`
  - **Research Status**: Comprehensive analysis and implementation plan completed

## Research Findings Summary  
**Current Project State:**
- ✅ Next.js 15 + TypeScript setup complete
- ✅ Supabase basic client/server configuration exists
- ✅ Shadcn/ui components and forms dependencies ready
- ✅ Jest/React Testing Library installed and configured
- ✅ Test directory structure created
- ✅ Comprehensive failing tests written (RED phase complete)
- ✅ Enhanced Supabase clients implemented
- ✅ Zod validation schemas created
- ❌ Authentication API routes NOT implemented yet
- ❌ Authentication forms and components NOT implemented yet
- ❌ Authentication middleware NOT implemented yet
- ❌ Database schema not implemented in Supabase yet

## TDD Implementation Progress

### ✅ RED PHASE COMPLETED (4 hours)
- **Testing Framework Setup**: Jest + React Testing Library configured
- **Test Structure**: Created `src/__tests__/` directory with organized subdirectories
- **API Route Tests**: Login, register, logout, callback route tests written
- **Component Tests**: LoginForm and RegisterForm component tests written
- **Middleware Tests**: Authentication middleware tests written
- **Verification**: All tests failing as expected (proper RED phase)

### 🚧 GREEN PHASE IN PROGRESS (8 hours total)
- **✅ Enhanced Supabase Clients**: Updated to use @supabase/ssr (1.5 hours)
- **✅ Zod Validation Schemas**: Complete auth validation schemas created (1 hour)
- **⏳ Next Steps Remaining**:
  - Authentication API routes implementation (2 hours)
  - Authentication form components (2.5 hours)
  - Authentication pages (1 hour)
  - Authentication middleware (1 hour)

## Implementation Plan Status
- **📋 TDD Roadmap**: Following Red-Green-Refactor approach ✅
- **🧪 Test Coverage**: Comprehensive failing tests in place ✅
- **⚡ Implementation**: 25% complete (2.5/8 hours of Green phase)
- **🗄️ Database Requirements**: SQL schemas ready to implement
- **✅ Success Criteria**: On track for 90%+ test coverage

## Technical Implementation Details
**Completed Components:**
1. **Supabase SSR Integration**: Upgraded from deprecated auth-helpers to @supabase/ssr
2. **Validation Layer**: Complete Zod schemas for auth forms with proper TypeScript types
3. **Test Foundation**: Comprehensive test suite covering all authentication flows
4. **Configuration**: Jest properly configured for Next.js 15 with module mapping

## Notes
- Following TDD approach: Red-Green-Refactor cycle ✅
- RED phase complete - all tests failing as expected ✅
- GREEN phase 25% complete - core infrastructure ready ✅
- Next session: Complete GREEN phase implementation (API routes, components, middleware)
