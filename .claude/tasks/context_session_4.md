# Context Session 4: Investment Opportunity Management API Design

## Session Overview
- **Agent**: research-agent (nextjs-fullstack-developer role)
- **Task**: Design API routes and business logic for Investment Opportunity Management
- **Date**: 2025-08-27
- **Status**: Completed

## Research Completed
I have completed comprehensive research and analysis of the Investment Opportunity Management API requirements and created a detailed implementation plan.

**Implementation Plan Location**: `.claude/doc/investment-opportunity-management-api-plan.md`

## Key Deliverables
1. **Complete Database Schema**: Comprehensive investment_opportunities table with supporting tables
2. **API Route Implementations**: All 6 required routes with proper authentication and validation
3. **Business Logic Patterns**: Financial calculations, validation utilities, and error handling
4. **Security Framework**: RLS policies, authentication middleware, and input sanitization
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Database indexes, caching strategies, and query optimization
6. **Testing Strategy**: TDD approach with unit and integration test examples

## Technical Architecture Summary
- **Next.js 15 App Router**: Production-ready API routes with proper error handling
- **Supabase Integration**: Database with RLS policies and Storage for document uploads
- **Zod Validation**: Comprehensive input validation schemas
- **Role-Based Access**: Deal sponsors can create, investors can view opportunities
- **Financial Calculations**: IRR, cash-on-cash returns, and investment metrics validation
- **File Upload System**: Secure document management with categorization

## Agent Consultation Results

### nextjs-fullstack-developer Agent
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
- **Documentation**: API research completed with route specifications
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - 6 core API routes with Next.js 15 App Router patterns
  - Database schema design with comprehensive RLS policies
  - Business logic patterns for financial calculations
  - File upload architecture with Supabase Storage
  - Authentication middleware with role-based access

## Implementation Phase Ready
All agent consultations completed. Ready to begin Phase 2 implementation following TDD approach:

1. **RED Phase**: Write all failing tests first
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implement minimum code to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining test success

## Key Implementation Notes
1. **TDD Approach**: All functionality requires failing tests first
2. **Security First**: Comprehensive authentication, authorization, and input validation
3. **Scalability**: Database design and API patterns optimized for growth
4. **Production Ready**: Error handling, rate limiting, caching, and monitoring

The comprehensive research and planning phase is complete. Ready to start implementing the Investment Opportunity Management system.
